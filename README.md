# Box-Creator-HTML-CSS-JS
My 1st project ever using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The programme takes input from the user for the width, height, x- position, y-position and color of the box and when the create button is clicked the box will be printed displayed on the screen using the dimension provide by the user.
